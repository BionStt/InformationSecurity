# Security Testing




Security Testing is successful when the following attributes of an application are intact
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Availability
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Non-Repudiation

Goal is to make sure that the sytem/application does not have any loopholes sytem fallbacks

* Authentication
  * To confirm that something or someone isauthentic â€“ true to the claims.
  * The digital identity of a user is validated andverified.
  * Is this person/package/application being truthful about their identity
* Authorization
  * To ensure that a person/program is authorized tosee the contents or make changes in anapplication.
  * User/Access rights are used.
  * Is the package/person allowed to do this operation?
* Availability
  * To ensure that an application is up and running; itsservices and information available as and whenneeded.
  * Number of failures are reduced and backups arekept ready.
  * Will this service do me good any time of the day?
* Confidentiality
  * To make sure that the information and servicesare available only when requested by and forintended users.
  * Penetration testing is done and defects are fixed.
  * Is the service and information sae from unauthorized prying eyes
* Integrity
  * To ensure that the service provides the user withcorrect information.
  * It is also essential to make sure that no obsoleteor outdated information is presented.
  * Does the service provide only the correct information to the user?
* Non-Repudiation
  * To ensure that the message was sent and receivedby authentic users only.
  * The sender/receiver must not be able to denytheir involvement.
  * Did the comminucation happen between two legimate users?



# When to start Security Testing?
* In general, testing must start early to minimizedefects and cost of quality.
* Security testing must start right from theRequirements Gathering phase to make sure thatthe quality of end-product is high.
* This is to ensure that any intentional/unintentionalunforeseen action does not halt or delay thesystem.

# SDLC and Security Testing
* Requirements Gathering --> Security Requirements Study
* Design -->  Develop Security Test Plan
* Development/Unit Testing -> White box Security Testing
* Integration Testing --> Black box Security Testing
* System Testing --> Vulnerability Scanning
* Deployment --> Penetration Testing
* Support/Maintenance -->Post-production analysis

# Security Testing Types
* Vulnerability Scanning
  * Scanning a system to findvulnerable signatures andloopholes.
* Penetration Testing
  * An attack from a hacker issimulated on the system.
* Ethical Hacking
  * The system is attacked fromwithin to expose all thesecurity flaws in the system.
* Risk Assessment
  * Observing the security risksin the system, classifyingthem as high, medium andlow.
* Security Scanning
  * Network/system weaknessare studies, analyzed andfixed.
* Security Review
  * To check that securitystandards have beenimplemented appropriatelythrough gap analysis andcode/design reviews.







* Dynamic Analysis (DAST)
* Static Analysis (SAST)
* Penetration Testing
* Fuzz Testing
* Interactive Application Security Testing
* Mobile Application Security
* Software Composition Analysis
* Software Testing Optimization
* Threat Intelligence
