Mobile App Security

#
* Is your application storing payment information or credit card details?
* Does your application use secure network protocols?
* Can they be switched to insecure ones?
* Does the application ask for more permissions than it needs?
* Does your application use certificates?
* Does your application use a Device ID as an identifier?
* Does your application require a user to be authenticated before they are allowed to access their data?
* Is there a maximum number of login attempts before they are locked out?

# The Process of Mobile Application Security Testing
There are three basic steps suggested by experts while performing security testing for mobile apps:
* Threat Modeling: 
	This method is used for identifying threats in the app
* Vulnerability Analysis: 
	This method is used for identifying vulnerabilities in the application with the previously created test cases using Runtime analysis, Dynamic methods, and forensic methods.
* Intelligence Gathering: 
	This method is used for gathering as much information as possible about the application



# Secure Coding Best Practices
* User authentication
* Authorizations
* Input validation mechanisms
* Configuration data protection
* Information confidentiality
* Information integrity
* Cryptography and key management
* Password policy
* Session management
* System administration interface protection
* Secure access to databases
* Endpoint protection for sensitive data
* Runtime error management
* Auditing & logging

# Black Box Penetration Testing

What is Black Box Testing?
Black box testing is the process of simulating a skilled attack, using the techniques and tools aimed to detect security vulnerabilities and exploit them.

Our experts will simulate a real attack on the application. The testing process covers a wide range of application-level vulnerabilities as defined by OWASP and WASC, targeting potentially harmful vulnerabilities in your application.

The testing process will reveal the vulnerabilities, potential exploitation damage and severity.

The detailed report you receive will include recommendations that will assist you in securing your systems and protecting your companies’ assets and integrity.

All application level vulnerabilities will be covered in the context of a Black Box test. Specifically, the testing methodologies used are OWASP and WASC, which provides full coverage over application level vulnerabilities. Some of the covered attacks:

# Vulnerabilities Covered
SQL Injection – taking control over the database
Hidden Backdoors – used by attackers to easily infiltrate the system over and over
Cross-site Scripting – injecting malicious code to innocent user browsers
Cross-site Request Forgery – impersonating an innocent user and performing actions in his name
Bypassing Authentication – taking over user and administrator accounts
Authorization Breaches – performing unauthorized actions and accessing unauthorized information
Bypassing Crypto – viewing confidential and private information by unauthorized people
Open Redirects – an open door to phishing attacks and scams
Command Injection – injecting commands to a remote server and taking over
Forceful Browsing – bypassing restrictions and performing unauthorized actions
Bypassing Business-Logic Restrictions – performing application-specific actions that are not authorized by the company’s regulations
LFI/RFI – injecting malicious code to a vulnerable application
Denial of Service – making the application unavailable to remote users


# Gray Box Penetration Testing

## Vulnerabilities Covered
Gray Box test provides a full, comprehensive test which results in a hybrid between finding vulnerabilities which are relevant for both White Box test and a Black Box test. The testing methodologies are OWASP and WASC methodologies which cover wide-range of application security vulnerabilities. Some of the covered vulnerabilities:

* SQL Injection – taking control over the database
* Hidden Backdoors – used by attackers to easily infiltrate the system over and over
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – injecting malicious code into innocent user’s browsers
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) – impersonating an innocent user and performing actions in his name
* Bypassing Authentication – taking over users and administrators accounts
* Authorization Breaches – performing unauthorized actions and accessing unauthorized information
* Bypassing Crypto – viewing of confidential and private info by unauthorized people
* Open Redirects – an open door to phishing attacks and scams
* Command Injection – injecting commands to a remote server and taking over
* Forceful Browsing – bypassing restrictions and perfoming unauthorized actions
* Bypassing Business-Logic Restrictions – performing application-specific actions that are not authorized by the company’s regulations
* LFI/RFI – injecting malicious code to a vulnerable application
* Denial of Service – making the application unavailable to remote users
